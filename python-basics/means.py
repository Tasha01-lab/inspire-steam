#Program to calculate means of numbers

#Averange of the first ten numbers
sum  = 0
for x in range (0,10):
    sum = sum + x

print(f"mean : {sum/10}")

#Average of the first even numbers
sum1 = 0
for k in range (0,100,2):
    sum1 = sum1 + k

print(f"mean of even numbers : {sum1/50}")

#Short cut for getting the mean
# % = modulus
print(3 % 2)
if (remainder == 1):
    print(odd number)
    else (remainder == 0)
    print(even number)
